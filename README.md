### Modification:
The original third part I wanted to design a calculator that records calories, but it did not meet the needs of tracking and recording. I reworked the design and created a new feature that records sushi types and viewing history.

## Development progress
Sushipigibiuti has gone through an iterative development process to ensure the highest quality and best user experience. This section outlines the major milestones, iterations, and improvements during development.

**Milestone 1:** Initial Planning and Prototyping
In the initial stages of development, I do research to understand the requirements and extend them. Explore and observe existing food websites to confirm general design direction. Based on observations, I created wireframes and prototypes to visualize user interface and user flow.

**Milestone 2:** With the wireframes and prototypes finalized, I started the development process. I chose css, html as well as js to ensure a scalable and efficient solution. At this stage, I collected a lot of sushi images and designed some pixelated sushi patterns in preparation for the webpage.

**Milestone 3:** In parallel with front-end development and UI improvements, I started implementing UI design. I'm also focusing on usability and responsiveness, making sure Sushipigibiuti is accessible across different devices and screen sizes. I did a small amount of user testing (discussions among classmates) and gathered feedback to iterate on the UI design. I improved the layout, color scheme, and interaction modes to create an intuitive and visually appealing experience.

**Milestone 4:** Iterative Development and User Feedback
Throughout the development process, I took an iterative approach, constantly searching for better interface changes and making modifications.
